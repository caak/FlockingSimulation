Code used to generate results for the paper
"Collaborative Intrusion Detection for Large Autonomous Drone Swarms"
submitted to SafeComp2021

Code is still work in progress, and I intend to clean it up and upload a more accessible version in the future.

All code is written by Simon Thougaard, PhD student at Missouri S&T, in the period 2020-2021
